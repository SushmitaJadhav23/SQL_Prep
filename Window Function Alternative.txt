## lead() and lag() function via subquery

SELECT
	user_id,
	month(date_time) as visit_month,
	month(date_time) - (
			     SELECT month(date_time) 
			     FROM tbl_activity
			     WHERE user_id = a.user_id AND
				   month(date_time) < month(a.date_time)
			     ORDER BY month(date_time) DESC 
                             LIMIT 1
				)   AS time_diff 
FROM tbl_activity a
GROUP BY user_id, month(date_time);

In above you would need to specify "<" / ">" to express "lead()" / "lag()" functionality in subquery and don't forget to use "ORDER BY" clause


SELECT
	user_id, 
	MONTH(date_time) AS visit_month,
        ( SELECT 
		month(date_time) 
	  FROM tbl_activity 
          WHERE 
		user_id = a.user_id AND
       		MONTH(date_time) > MONTH(a.date_time)
          ORDER BY MONTH(date_time) 
	  LIMIT 1 ) as lead

FROM tbl_activity a
GROUP BY user_id, MONTH(date_time);
